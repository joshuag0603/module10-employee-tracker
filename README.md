# Employee Tracker

## Description

This project is a employee tracker which displays employee departments, roles, salaries, and managers. The project uses Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL. During this project I learned how to connect to a PostgreSQL database and update the database using .sql files. 

## Installation

Run the command "npm i" in the terminal at the root level to install the npm packages for the project. Also add a .env file with the database credentials necessary to connect to PostgreSQL. 

## Usage

The application can be accessed by running the command node index.js from the src folder. Then the user can view the departments, roles, and employees.
